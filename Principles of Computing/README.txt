There are two parts of the course.

Part 1 will focus on Python programming skills applied in mathematical problem solving including Plotting and Grids, Probability, Combinatorics, and Counting.

Part 2 will focus on concepts such as recursion, assertions, and invariants. The mathematical portion of the class will focus on searching, sorting, and recursive data structures.

This course will prepare you for a structured approach to developing and analyzing algorithms in a higher level.
